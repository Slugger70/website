**Galaxy-ELIXIR Webinar Series: FAIR data and Open Infrastructures to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic**

The Galaxy Community and ELIXIR have organised a webinar series to demonstrate how open software and public research infrastructures can be used in analysing and publishing SARS-CoV2 data.

### Session 3: Cheminformatics: Screening of the main protease
14 May 2020, 17.00-18.00 CEST (starts at 16.00 BST, 11.00 EDT, 8.00 PDT) (15 May 2020 @ 1:00am AEST.)

This session will present the [Galaxy workflow to identify candidate molecules for COVID-19 drug treatment, using molecular docking simulation](https://covid19.galaxyproject.org/cheminformatics/), which predict which molecules are most likely to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 main protein.

The computationally intensive workflow was executed through a distributed compute network available via the Galaxy Europe platform. The webinar will present methods and workflows forthe identification of potential COVID-19 drug candidates. Special emphasis will be given to the complex methods that have been applied and that have consumed more than 25 CPU and GPU years for this tasks.
