### Summary: 

A summary and further details can be found at: [Melbourne Bioinformatics Training and Events](https://www.melbournebioinformatics.org.au/training-and-events/)

<br/>

**Online data analysis for biologists**:

This interactive beginners’ workshop will provide an introduction to using Galaxy for online data analysis. It is based on our Introduction to Galaxy workshop, now being offered across Australia through the Australian BioCommons.

<br/>

**RNA-seq analysis: from reads to differentially expressed genes**

Across two days attendees can expect to gain an understanding of approaches to, and practical experience in, quality control of short reads, alignment, gene counts, data normalisation, differential expression and visualisation. Places are limited to encourage discussion. Our very experienced RNA-seq and Galaxy trainers will be present to answer all your questions.

<br/>

**Hybrid de novo genome assembly – Nanopore & Illumina**

Performing de novo assembly is easier than ever thanks to advances in long read sequencing and platforms such as Galaxy which enable bioinformatics workflows for non-coders. In this tutorial we will use the web-based analysis platform “Galaxy” to create a high-quality assembly of a Bacillus Subtilis strain. The software tools “Flye” and then “Pilon” will be used to perform the assembly and subsequent error correction to improve the accuracy of assembled contigs. You will learn how to will visualize input read sets and the assemblies produced at each stage and assess the quality of the final assembly.
