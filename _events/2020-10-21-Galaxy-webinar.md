**Data analysis without the need for programming experience**

Galaxy is your ultimate research buddy -  an online platform for biological research that gives you access to computational data analysis tools and workflows without the need for programming experience. It is supported by a rich collection of training materials and an active community of scientists.

In this webinar we explore how Galaxy can transform your research through access to high performance computing power coupled with open, reproducible computational workflows and support from the Galaxy community. 

Weâ€™ll look at real-life examples of how Galaxy workflows are being applied to integrative meta-omics of microbial communities and how Galaxy is being leveraged to address the global challenges of COVID-19 research.

**Presenters:** Dr Gareth Price, Service Manager, Galaxy Australia & Dr Johan Gustafsson, Bioinformatics Engagement Officer, Australian BioCommons 

**Who the webinar is for:** This webinar is suitable for life-science researchers. No prior knowledge of Galaxy or programming is required.

**Date/time:** 04 Nov 2020 - 13:00-14:00 AEDT / 12:00-13:00 AEST / 10:00-11.00 AWST
