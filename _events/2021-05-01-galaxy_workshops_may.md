**Variant calling in humans, animals and plants with Galaxy**:

In this online workshop we focus on the tools and workflows available for variant calling in polyploid organisms in Galaxy Australia. During the workshop you will get hands-on experience using Freebayes for variant calling and SnpEff and GEMINI for variant annotation. The workshop makes use of data from a case study on diagnosing a genetic disease however the tools and workflows are equally applicable to other polyploid organisms and biological questions.

<br/>

**Viral variant calling with Galaxy**

During the workshop you will get hands-on experience using BWA-MEM for alignment, lofreq for variant calling and SnpEff for annotating variant effects. The workshop makes use of COVID-19 variant calling data however the tools and workflows are equally applicable to other viruses and biological questions.

<br/>

**Bacterial variant calling with Galaxy**

During the workshop you will get hands-on experience using Snippy for genetic variation detection and annotation, and JBrowse to visualise variants. The workshop makes use of data from a case study on antimicrobial resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis however the tools and workflows are equally applicable to other bacteria and biological questions.

<br/>

These workshop are free but participation is subject to application with selection. **Applications close at 5pm AEST Wednesday 12 May 2021.**

You must be associated with an Australian organisation and provide an appropriate organisational email address for your application to be considered. 

Applications will be reviewed by the organising committee and all applicants will be informed of the status of their application (successful, waiting list, unsuccessful) by Friday 14 May 2021. Successful applicants will be provided with a Zoom meeting link closer to the date.
