BCC2020 is packed full of joint & parallel sessions, keynotes, poster & demo sessions, birds-of-a-feather, and social events. The meeting encompasses a week of activities, including two optional pre-conference training days, a three-day main meeting, and four post-meeting collaboration days. You can choose some or all of it to attend.

**BCC2020 will be online, global and affordable. We will be inviting our community to engage in new ways, and hope that BCC2020 will be an important space for discussion for the bioinformatics community.**
