**GCC2021 will be virtual, global and affordable.**

The 2021 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2021) has moved to a virtual format. See the announcement for more information. We will miss gathering in person, but this enables us to do some things we canâ€™t at an in person event.

* GCC2021 Training will be offered the entire week of 28 June.
* GCC2021 Conference events will be held twice, once in their original Ghent time zone (GCC EMEA + APAC3), and again 9 hours later in the Americas (GCC Americas).
* Registration rates are a fraction of the cost of an in person event, and include significant discounts for students and researchers based in the developing world.

</br>

GCC2021 will be globally accessible, in any time zone, on every continent, and in every country.

</br>

GCC brings together hundreds of faculty, clinicians, researchers, and students, all working in and supporting data intensive science that is accessible, sharable and reproducible.
