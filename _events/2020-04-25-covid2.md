**Galaxy-ELIXIR Webinar Series: FAIR data and Open Infrastructures to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic**

The Galaxy Community and ELIXIR have organised a webinar series to demonstrate how open software and public research infrastructures can be used in analysing and publishing SARS-CoV2 data.

### Session 2: Genomics/Variant Calling
7 May 2020, 17.00-18.00 CEST (starts at 16.00 BST, 11.00 EDT, 8.00 PDT) (08 May 2020 @ 1:00am AEST.)

The second session will present the [initial analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, published on bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.21.959973). It will guide the participants through accessing and collecting the available datasets, the genome assembly and the analysis of the within-sample sequence variants. It will also explain how to deploy on a Galaxy instance all the tools and workflows needed to reproduce the analysis.
