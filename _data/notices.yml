              Galaxy Australia is currently experiencing performance issues with internal data transfer speeds. Please be aware that while jobs are still currently running that the time it is taking for these jobs to complete is much longer than normal. While we are working behind the scenes to rectify this as soon as possible, we currently do not expect this issue to be resolved before the 30th October. There are other options for you if your job is urgent, please reach out to our support service (<a href="mailto:help@genome.edu.au">help@genome.edu.au</a>) so we can discuss these with you.
