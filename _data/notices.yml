              Galaxy Australia is migrating elements of its supporting hardware to provide greater access to the service and to your data. Already achieved is the migration of read data, meaning you can access tools, histories and workflows. Newly submitted jobs will be processed but the queue time is still slow. We are continuing to provide performance gains to the job queue. If you experience any ongoing issues using the service please contact support for assistance: [help@genome.edu.au](mailto:help@genome.edu.au).

#             Due to circumstances beyond our control the scheduled outage **will not occur at 17:00 on 30 September 2020 AEST** and job submission will continue as normal beyond 9:00am on the 30 September. While the service is available, we are experiencing longer than normal job queueing times as a consequence of the previously advertised outage. We expected these to resolve in the coming weeks. If you experience any ongoing  issues using the service please contact support for assistance: <a href="mailto:help@genome.edu.au">help@genome.edu.au</a>.
