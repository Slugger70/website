**The Genomics Virtual Lab (GVL) has had an update to version 5!**

* The GVL 5.0 is a ground-up rewrite of the GVL based on Kubernetes and containerization technologies
* Production grade out of the box, with scalability, zero downtime configuration changes, better security, fully integrated Grafana metrics, containerized tools, as well as near equivalent toolset and reference data to usegalaxy.org
* Easily launchable on 4 cloud providers - Amazon, Google, Jetstream, and NeCTAR, and can be manually installed in other Kubernetes environments
* Launches with auto renewing SSL certificates and cloud DNS support
* Unified authentication through KeyCloak
* API-driven and fully programmable
* Support for partitioning a GVL into multiple, isolated projects is under active development, including support for multiple applications in each project with access control lists
