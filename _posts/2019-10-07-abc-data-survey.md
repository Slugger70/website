**Calling all Australian life science researchers who move data!**
<br/>
The [Australian BioCommons](https://biocommons.org.au) is a new NCRIS-funded digital capability that will enhance national bioinformatics infrastructure for environmental, agricultural and biomedical researchers. We want to know about your research data movement challenges.

Please help inform us so that we can improve bioinformatics infrastructure and resources nationally by completing our 10 minute survey on data movement.
