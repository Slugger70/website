**Nanopore tools installed**
<br/>
Galaxy Australia has been updated with a new set of tools for processing **Nanopore** data. The tools include:

* Poretools
* Porechop
* Nanoplot
* Canu
* Flye
* Nanopolish

The majority of Nanopore tools are located under *Genomic File Manipulation - Nanopore*, except for the assemblers (*Flye* and *Canu*) which are in *Assembly.*

Other tools to support Nanopore data will be installed soon.
