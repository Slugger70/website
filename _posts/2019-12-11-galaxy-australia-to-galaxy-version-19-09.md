This morning after a brief planned outage, Galaxy Australia was upgraded to the latest version of Galaxy. You will notice some changes straight away - The tool menu is a bit easier to read now. Everything else is the same however!

This release includes:

* Workflow reporting
* New visualisations
* Cleaner history menu

Please see the [user release notes](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/release_19.09/releases/19.09_announce_user.html) for additional information.
